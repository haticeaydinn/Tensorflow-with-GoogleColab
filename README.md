HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

Problem definition: It is a very simple and not-real machine learning problem and I implement it only to learn tf functions. I will predict house prices. data consists of two columns: house size and price. I created data with random function. Also, it's a linear regression problem.

Prediction formula: size_factor * house_size + price_offset
size_factor = w (weight)
price_offset = b (bias)
We will learn size_factor and price_offset from the data.

Loss function: Mean squared error
